Data Science learning path involves mastering core technologies such as Python programming, statistics, and foundational machine learning concepts. Then, you progress to exploring data processing and visualization tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Next, you can delve into machine learning frameworks and libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, as well as knowledge in deep learning. Understanding data engineering aspects is also crucial, including skills in data cleaning, transformation, and storage technologies such as SQL and NoSQL databases. Continuous learning and hands-on practice through solving real-world problems and engaging in projects are essential for skill advancement.
